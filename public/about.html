<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Christina Young Tessier and I am a Graphic Designer, Photographer, and Storyteller at heart. 
  Even when I was little, whether it was drawing pictures, shooting with my 35mm point & click camera, or writing short stories, 
  I loved to define or find the story, frame it, and bring it to life. </p>

<p>I started Saidah Designs several years ago as a young mom trying to pursue her love for creativity while also being home 
  with a newborn...no small task! Over a decade later I have had the pleasure of working with clients from Germany to several 
  US states, and each time I am just as excited to approach the next challenge and find the story.</p>

<p>Are you in need of marketing or design help? What is your story?</p>
